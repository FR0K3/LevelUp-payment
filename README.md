# LevelUp - Payment Assignment
This website is designed to take in credit card information and validate through an API. This task is split into two parts, frontend and backend.

## Backend - API
This API was made using as main technology Spring Boot.

### How to Run
In order to run the aplication you have to be in the directory `payment-api` and you have to open your terminal window.

Once your terminal window is open you have to run the following command:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

You should see an output similar to the following:
```
> Task :bootRun

  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::                (v3.1.3)

```

Now you can start using the API which port is 8080 :)

## Frontend
